> how do i run this??

you have to install the deps with pip (or your distribution's package manager)

    pip install discord.py openai aiohttp

    
then, fill in your discord bot's token from the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) into the BOT_TOKEN part and also fill in the empty info, or replace with whatever your heart desires but make SURE it's valid

> this code sucks
