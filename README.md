discord LLM bot with /ask and /info commands

> how do i run this??

you have to install discord.py and openai with pip (or your distribution's package manager)

    pip install discord.py openai

    
then, fill in your discord bot's token from the [discord developer portal] (https://discord.com/developers/applications) into the BOT_TOKEN part (dont delete the "" symbols)
and then you're good to go! add the bot as an app by clicking on the link in the console

> this code sucks
